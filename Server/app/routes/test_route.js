Key Point:
You donâ€™t need to pass req, res, or next explicitly when calling middleware or controller functions in the route definition. fr ex ( validate,getUsers) just the name of the function
Express automatically handles this (the passing of these parameters that these functions take) for you when a request is processed. However, your middleware and controller functions should be designed to accept these parameters, 
as Express will inject them during execution.

Summary:
Middleware (validate): Automatically receives req, res, and next. Express calls next() if there are no validation errors, moving to the next step in the chain.
Controller (getUsers): Automatically receives req and res from Express, allowing you to handle the request without manually passing these parameters.
